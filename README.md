# Giphy

Giphy Week 6 Assignment UTM

In this assignment, I was told to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. To finish this task, I must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

# How this Works

- I have created an Array of few comedians, made individal buttons and linked them in such a way that it will give you 10 gifs, and ratings respectively.

- In add button search, user types in name and when they press the add button, it will creat button with that name and will append along with existing buttons and if user clicks that button, then it will give you 10 gifs, and ratings respectively.

- If refresh the page, it was start with default buttons.
